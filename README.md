# **Student Grading System**
This project is a simple JavaScript program that computes and displays a student's grade, determines whether the student passed or failed a course, and returns an appropriate message based on the student's score and the class average.

## **Features**
* **Calculate Class Average**: Computes the average score from a list of scores.
* **Determine Student Grade**: Assigns a grade (A++, A, B, C, D, F) based on the student's score.
* **Check Passing Status**: Determines if the student has passed the course by comparing the student's score with the class average.
* **Return Feedback Message**: Provides feedback to the student, including the class average, the student's grade, and whether they passed or failed.

## **How it Works**
1. The getAverage function computes the class average by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.
2. The getGrade function determines the letter grade based on the student's score.
3. The hasPassingGrade function checks if the student's grade is passing (anything but an "F").
4. The studentMsg function generates the final message, including:
5. The class average.
6. The student's grade.
7. Whether the student passed or failed the course.
